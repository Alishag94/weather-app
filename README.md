🌦️ Weather App

A responsive and interactive weather forecast app built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), and JavaScript. This app allows users to search for weather by city name, fetches real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API, and displays current temperature, a 7-day forecast, weather icons, animated backgrounds, and ambient sounds (rain, snow, wind, birds).

🧪 What I Learned

How to use APIs in JavaScript

Handling user input and asynchronous requests

Error handling and user feedback

Multi-city weather comparison logic

Improving app performance and layout using AI tools

🚧 Challenges

Managing API responses and chaining async requests was initially tricky

Handling edge cases like invalid cities or empty input

Merging Git conflicts during deployment setup

✨ Future Improvements
