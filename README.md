🌦️ Weather App
A responsive and interactive weather forecast app built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), and JavaScript. This app allows users to search for weather by city name, fetches real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API, and displays current temperature, a 7-day forecast, weather icons, animated backgrounds, and ambient sounds (rain, snow, wind, birds).
